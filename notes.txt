# return type of transcipt is a dictionary of this format:

[
    {
        'start': 0.0,        # Start time of the transcript segment (in seconds)
        'duration': 5.0,     # Duration of the segment (in seconds)
        'text': 'Hello, welcome to the video!'  # The actual transcript text for this segment
    },
    {
        'start': 5.0,
        'duration': 3.0,
        'text': 'In this video, we will discuss Python programming.'

Key Components:
    messages List: A list of dictionaries that represent the conversation.
    Each dictionary has two keys: role and content.
        role: Specifies the type of participant in the conversation.
        Common roles:
            "system": Provides instructions to the model about its behavior.
            "user": Represents the user's input.
            "assistant": The model's response (not provided here; it's generated by the API).
        First Entry ("role": "system"):
            Purpose: Sets the behavior of the assistant.
            Content: "You are a helpful assistant." instructs the model to behave like a helpful assistant during the conversation.
        Second Entry ("role": "user"):
            Purpose: Represents the user's input.
            Content:
            The user asks the model to answer a question based on a given transcript.
    The string includes:
    transcript_text: The extracted text from the YouTube video.
    question: The specific query the user wants answered.

    The store=True parameter is used within the client.chat.completions.create() method. This parameter instructs the API to store the generated completion for future reference or analysis.
    Purpose of store=True:
        Data Retention: By setting store=True, the API retains the generated completion. This is useful for auditing, training improvements, or revisiting past interactions.
        Model Distillation: Storing high-quality outputs can aid in refining and distilling models. According to OpenAI's documentation, using the store parameter in the chat completions API allows for the storage of outputs, which can be evaluated and utilized in model distillation processes.

    Considerations:
        Data Privacy: Ensure that storing completions aligns with your application's privacy policies and complies with relevant data protection regulations.
        Storage Management: Be mindful of storage limitations and manage stored data appropriately to prevent unnecessary accumulation.
        If you prefer not to store the completion, you can omit the store parameter or set it to False. This will prevent the API from retaining the generated output.
